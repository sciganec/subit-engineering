# SUBIT — Semantic Engineering

SUBIT is a discrete semantic coordinate system for constructing, analyzing, and engineering meaning. It defines 64 semantic elements, 8 valence trigrams, 3 bigrams of subjectivity, and a crystalline topology that allows any semantic act to be expressed as a precise, formalized state.

Semantic Engineering is the discipline that uses SUBIT as its core for designing semantic spaces, modeling subjectivity, defining operational mechanics, and building systems that treat meaning as a structured, engineerable domain.

## Purpose

SUBIT provides:

- a discrete map of semantic space  
- a universal set of 64 semantic elements  
- 8 valence operations (trigrams)  
- 3 bigrams of subjectivity (WHO / WHERE / WHEN)  
- binary and trigram addressing  
- a crystalline structure for semantic engineering  

The system applies to AI modeling, knowledge graphs, UX semantics, cognitive interfaces, narrative systems, and any domain where meaning must be formalized.

## SUBIT Axiom

Any semantic act can be described as:

**element (64) × valence (8) × subjectivity (3 bigrams)**

This creates a discrete space of 64 positions, each with:

- inner valence  
- outer valence  
- binary address  
- bigram address  
- trigram (valence + color) code

## System Structure

### SUBIT‑3 (bigrams)
- WHO: ME / YOU / WE / THEY  
- WHERE: EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH  
- WHEN: SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER  

### SUBIT‑8 (valence trigrams)
S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N  
Each valence corresponds to a canonical color.

### SUBIT‑64 (semantic elements)
64 archetypes, each defined by an inner→outer valence pair.

---

## Addressing

### Binary (6‑bit)
- bits 1–2: WHO  
- bits 3–4: WHERE  
- bits 5–6: WHEN  

### Bigram
Each bit pair decodes into a subjectivity, spatial, and temporal mode.

### Trigram
Valence defines the operational mode and its color.

---

## Periodic Table

SUBIT‑64 is organized as an 8×8 table:

- rows = inner valences  
- columns = outer valences  
- each cell = one semantic element  

This functions as a semantic analogue of the chemical periodic table.

## Semantic Engineering

Semantic Engineering is the engineering of meaning‑structures, including:

- ontological design  
- content architecture  
- semantic chemistry  
- subjectivity topology  
- contextual operational modes  

SUBIT is its crystalline core.
