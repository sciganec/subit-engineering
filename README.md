# SUBIT — Semantic Engineering

SUBIT is a discrete semantic coordinate system for constructing, analyzing, and engineering meaning. It defines 64 semantic elements formed by the interaction of inner valences (tensions) and outer valences (colors), supported by binary and bigram subjectivity coordinates. This crystalline structure enables meaning to be treated as a formal, engineerable domain.

Semantic Engineering is the discipline built on SUBIT. It provides the methods and structures for designing semantic systems, modeling subjectivity, defining operational mechanics, and building meaning‑aware architectures.

## Purpose

SUBIT establishes:

- a discrete semantic lattice of 64 elements  
- inner valences (tensions) that define internal semantic force  
- outer valences (colors) that define external semantic expression  
- binary addressing for subjectivity  
- bigram coordinates for WHO / WHERE / WHEN  
- a crystalline topology for semantic engineering  

The system applies to AI, knowledge representation, UX semantics, cognitive interfaces, and any domain requiring structured meaning.

## Inner Valence (Tension)

Inner valence encodes the internal semantic force that drives an element’s operation.

- **S — Source tension**  
- **V — Vector tension**  
- **F — Field tension**  
- **M — Form tension**  
- **T — Turn tension**  
- **C — Compression tension**  
- **D — Disintegration tension**  
- **N — Null tension**

Inner valence defines what the element *does* internally.

## Outer Valence (Color)

Outer valence encodes the external semantic expression of the element.  
Each color is represented by a two‑letter code.

- **Bl — Blue**  
- **Gr — Green**  
- **Lm — Lime**  
- **Yl — Yellow**  
- **Or — Orange**  
- **Rd — Red**  
- **Bg — Burgundy**  
- **Pu — Purple**

Outer valence defines how the element *appears* externally.

## SUBIT‑64 Semantic Elements

Each element is a combination of:

- inner tension (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- outer color (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)

Example formats:

- **SBl** — Source tension → Blue color  
- **MOr** — Form tension → Orange color  
- **DPu** — Disintegration tension → Purple color  

These 64 combinations form the semantic periodic table.

## Subjectivity Coordinates (SUBIT‑3)

Every semantic act is situated within three binary bigrams:

- **WHO**: ME / WE / YOU / THEY  
- **WHERE**: EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH  
- **WHEN**: SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER  

Each bigram is encoded as a 2‑bit pair, forming a 6‑bit binary address.

---

## Binary Addressing

The 6‑bit address is structured as:

- bits 1–2: WHO  
- bits 3–4: WHERE  
- bits 5–6: WHEN  

This creates 64 subjectivity states, each combinable with any valence pair.

## The SUBIT Crystal

The SUBIT Crystal is an 8×8 lattice:

- rows = inner valences (tensions)  
- columns = outer valences (colors)  
- each cell = one semantic element  

This crystalline topology provides:

- symmetry  
- orthogonality  
- locality  
- color topology  
- navigable semantic geometry  

It functions as the semantic analogue of a periodic table.

## Semantic Engineering

Semantic Engineering is the engineering of meaning‑structures. It includes:

- ontological design  
- content architecture  
- semantic chemistry  
- subjectivity topology  
- contextual operational mechanics  

SUBIT is the crystalline core of this discipline.
