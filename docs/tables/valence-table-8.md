# Valence Table (8 Semantic Valences)

The SUBIT valence system consists of eight fundamental semantic modes.  
Each valence appears in two synchronized forms:

- **inner valence (tension)** — one‑letter operational force  
- **outer valence (color)** — two‑letter expressive mode  

Together they form the dual‑axis structure of the SUBIT Crystal.

## Inner Valences (Tensions)

Inner valences describe the internal semantic force of an element.  
They define how meaning behaves from within.

| Code | Name                    | Structural Function |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| S    | Source                  | emergence, ignition, origination |
| V    | Vector                  | directed push, orientation |
| F    | Field                   | expansion, diffusion |
| M    | Form                    | structuring, shaping |
| T    | Turn                    | reorientation, pivot |
| C    | Compression             | contraction, focusing |
| D    | Disintegration          | breaking apart, dissolution |
| N    | Null                    | suspension, clearing |

## Outer Valences (Colors)

Outer valences describe the external semantic expression of an element.  
They define how meaning appears outwardly.

| Code | Color     | Structural Expression |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| Bl   | Blue      | calm initiation |
| Gr   | Green     | guided growth |
| Lm   | Lime      | open expansion |
| Yl   | Yellow    | structural clarity |
| Or   | Orange    | dynamic shift |
| Rd   | Red       | compression, intensity |
| Bg   | Burgundy  | fragmentation, decay |
| Pu   | Purple    | suspension, void |

## Combined Valence Identity

A SUBIT element is defined by combining:

- **inner tension** (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- **outer color** (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)

Examples:

- **SBl** — Source tension expressed as Blue  
- **MOr** — Form tension expressed as Orange  
- **DPu** — Disintegration tension expressed as Purple  

These 64 combinations form the full SUBIT‑64 lattice.

---

## Structural Role

The eight valences define the two axes of the SUBIT Crystal:

- rows = inner valences (tensions)  
- columns = outer valences (colors)

Their interaction produces the canonical 8×8 semantic matrix.

## Summary

The valence system provides the operational and expressive foundation of SUBIT:

- **8 inner tensions**  
- **8 outer colors**  
- **64 combined elements**  

This table defines the core mechanics of the SUBIT semantic lattice.
