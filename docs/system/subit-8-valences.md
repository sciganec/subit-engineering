# SUBIT‑8 Valences

SUBIT‑8 defines the eight fundamental semantic valences used in the SUBIT system.  
Each valence has two aspects:

- **inner valence (tension)** — the internal semantic force  
- **outer valence (color)** — the external semantic expression  

Inner valences are represented by **one letter**.  
Outer valences are represented by a **two‑letter color code**.

Together they form the operational and expressive axes of the SUBIT Crystal.

## Inner Valences (Tensions)

Inner valences describe the internal semantic operation of an element.  
They define how meaning behaves from within.

| Code | Name                    | Description |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| S    | Source tension          | spontaneous emergence, ignition, origination |
| V    | Vector tension          | directed push, orientation, propulsion |
| F    | Field tension           | expansion, diffusion, outward spread |
| M    | Form tension            | structuring, shaping, patterning |
| T    | Turn tension            | reorientation, pivot, rotation |
| C    | Compression tension     | contraction, focusing, limiting |
| D    | Disintegration tension  | breaking apart, dissolving, collapse |
| N    | Null tension            | clearing, emptying, suspension |

Inner valence answers:  
**What internal force is acting?**

## Outer Valences (Colors)

Outer valences describe the external semantic expression of an element.  
They define how meaning appears outwardly.

| Code | Color     | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Bl   | Blue      | calm initiation, cool emergence |
| Gr   | Green     | directional growth, guidance |
| Lm   | Lime      | radiant expansion, openness |
| Yl   | Yellow    | structural clarity, definition |
| Or   | Orange    | dynamic shift, rotation |
| Rd   | Red       | intensity, compression, force |
| Bg   | Burgundy  | decay, fragmentation, release |
| Pu   | Purple    | void, suspension, neutrality |

Outer valence answers:  
**How does the element manifest externally?**

## Combined Valence Identity

A semantic element is defined by combining:

- **inner tension** (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- **outer color** (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)

Examples:

- **SBl** — Source tension → Blue expression  
- **MOr** — Form tension → Orange expression  
- **DPu** — Disintegration tension → Purple expression  

These 64 combinations form the SUBIT‑64 semantic elements.

## Role in the SUBIT Crystal

SUBIT‑8 provides the two axes of the SUBIT Crystal:

- rows = inner valences (tensions)  
- columns = outer valences (colors)  

The interaction of these axes produces the 8×8 semantic lattice.

## Summary

SUBIT‑8 defines the operational and expressive foundations of the semantic system:

- **inner valence** = internal force  
- **outer valence** = external color  
- **8 × 8 combinations** = 64 semantic elements  

These valences form the core mechanics of Semantic Engineering.
