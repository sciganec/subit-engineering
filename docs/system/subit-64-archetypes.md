# SUBIT‑64 Archetypes

SUBIT‑64 is the complete set of 64 semantic archetypes formed by combining one inner valence (tension) with one outer valence (color). Each archetype represents a stable semantic element within the SUBIT Crystal. The full system is an 8×8 lattice where rows correspond to tensions and columns correspond to colors.

Each archetype has:
- an inner valence (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- an outer valence (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)  
- a combined code (e.g., SBl, MOr, DPu)  
- a structural definition describing its semantic operation  

This document lists all 64 archetypes in canonical order.

# Summary

SUBIT‑64 defines the complete semantic periodic table.  
Each archetype is a precise combination of:

- **inner tension** (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- **outer color** (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)

This lattice forms the crystalline foundation of Semantic Engineering.
