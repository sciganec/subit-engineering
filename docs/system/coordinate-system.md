# Coordinate System

The SUBIT coordinate system describes how every semantic element is addressed inside the SUBIT lattice.  
A SUBIT‑coordinate is always a combination of:

- **two trigrams** (inner tension + outer color)  
- **three bigrams** (WHO, WHERE, WHEN)  
- **six polarities** (the six bits that generate all of the above)

All three layers describe the *same* underlying 6‑bit structure.  
Nothing is added or duplicated — each representation is simply a different projection of the same binary core.

---

## Six Polarities

The foundation of SUBIT is a 6‑bit vector:

**SUBIT = {0,1}⁶**

These six polarities are the atomic semantic units.  
Everything else in SUBIT is a structured interpretation of these six bits.

---

## Three Bigrams (WHO, WHERE, WHEN)

The six bits group into three bigrams:

- **WHO** — subject  
- **WHERE** — vector  
- **WHEN** — phase  

Each bigram has four possible states:

**10, 11, 01, 00**

This yields:

- WHO = ME / WE / YOU / THEY  
- WHERE = EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH  
- WHEN = SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER  

Thus:

**SUBIT = {4 bigram}³ = 64 subjectivity states**

---

## Two Trigrams (Inner + Outer)

The same six bits can be interpreted as two trigrams:

- **inner trigram** — tension  
- **outer trigram** — color  

Each trigram has eight possible states:

**100, 101, 110, 111, 011, 010, 001, 000**

These map to:

- **8 tensions** (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- **8 colors** (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)

Thus:

**SUBIT = {8 trigram}² = 64 valento‑color elements**

---

## Unified Coordinate

A SUBIT coordinate is the *single* 6‑bit address expressed simultaneously in two forms:

- **trigram form** → inner tension + outer color  
- **bigram form** → WHO + WHERE + WHEN  

Example:

- Trigram: **FOr**  
- Bigram: **11 10 00**  
- Unified coordinate: **FOr · 11 10 00**

Both refer to the same underlying 6‑bit state.

---

## Coordinate Space

The SUBIT coordinate space contains:

- **64 subjectivity states** (bigram view)  
- **64 valento‑color elements** (trigram view)  
- **1 underlying binary structure** (six polarities)

Total semantic states: **64**  
Total binary states: **64**  
Total archetypes: **64**

All three numbers coincide because they describe the same space.

---

## Semantic Interpretation

- The **bigram layer** answers: *from which subjectivity does the act arise?*  
- The **trigram layer** answers: *what is the operational nature of the act?*  
- The **binary layer** answers: *what is the exact position in the 6‑bit lattice?*

These layers are not separate systems — they are synchronized readings of the same coordinate.

---

## Summary

SUBIT is a single 6‑bit semantic space expressed through:

- **two trigrams** (inner tension + outer color)  
- **three bigrams** (WHO, WHERE, WHEN)  
- **six polarities** (binary core)

This unified coordinate system forms the crystalline structure of SUBIT and defines all 64 archetypes.
