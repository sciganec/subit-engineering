# Trigram Addressing

Trigram addressing in SUBIT defines the operational identity of a semantic element by combining its inner valence (tension) and outer valence (color). While binary addressing encodes subjectivity (WHO/WHERE/WHEN), trigram addressing encodes the *semantic operation itself*.

A trigram is the minimal operational signature of a SUBIT element.

## Components of a Trigram

A trigram consists of two coordinated parts:

- **inner valence (tension)** — one‑letter code  
- **outer valence (color)** — two‑letter code  

Together they form a **three‑character operational identity**, for example:

- SBl  
- MOr  
- DPu  

This identity defines how the element behaves internally and how it expresses itself externally.

## Inner Valence (Tension)

The internal semantic force of the element.

| Code | Name                    |
|------|--------------------------|
| S    | Source tension          |
| V    | Vector tension          |
| F    | Field tension           |
| M    | Form tension            |
| T    | Turn tension            |
| C    | Compression tension     |
| D    | Disintegration tension  |
| N    | Null tension            |

Inner valence answers: **What internal force is acting?**

---

## Outer Valence (Color)

The external semantic expression of the element.

| Code | Color     |
|------|-----------|
| Bl   | Blue      |
| Gr   | Green     |
| Lm   | Lime      |
| Yl   | Yellow    |
| Or   | Orange    |
| Rd   | Red       |
| Bg   | Burgundy  |
| Pu   | Purple    |

Outer valence answers: **How does the element manifest externally?**

---

## Trigram Format

The trigram is always written as:

**Inner + Outer**

Examples:

- **SBl** — Source tension expressed as Blue  
- **VGr** — Vector tension expressed as Green  
- **TLm** — Turn tension expressed as Lime  
- **CRd** — Compression tension expressed as Red  
- **NPu** — Null tension expressed as Purple  

This format is compact, unambiguous, and canonical across all SUBIT documentation.

## Role of Trigram Addressing

Trigram addressing provides:

- a universal identifier for each semantic element  
- a compact operational signature  
- a direct mapping to the SUBIT Crystal (8×8 lattice)  
- a bridge between structural mechanics (tension) and expressive mode (color)  

Every SUBIT‑64 archetype is uniquely defined by its trigram.

## Trigram vs Binary Addressing

| Layer            | Purpose                                   | Format        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Binary (6‑bit)   | Subjectivity (WHO/WHERE/WHEN)              | 10 01 11      |
| Trigram          | Semantic operation (tension + color)       | SBl, MOr, DPu |

Binary = *context*  
Trigram = *operation*  

A complete semantic coordinate combines both.

---

## Complete Semantic Coordinate

A fully specified semantic act includes:

- **Trigram** (semantic operation)  
- **Binary address** (subjectivity)  

Example:

- Trigram: **FOr**  
- Binary: **11 10 00**  
- Decoded: SpreadTurn + WE/EAST/WINTER  

This produces a unique, fully defined semantic state.

---

## Summary

Trigram addressing is the operational identity system of SUBIT.  
It encodes each semantic element as:

- **inner valence (tension)**  
- **outer valence (color)**  

forming a three‑character signature that defines how meaning behaves and how it appears within the SUBIT Crystal.
