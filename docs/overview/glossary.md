# Glossary

This glossary defines the core terms used in SUBIT and Semantic Engineering.  
All definitions are structural, neutral, and aligned with the canonical SUBIT specification.

---

## Semantic Engineering
The discipline that treats meaning as an engineerable domain. It defines semantic elements, valences, coordinates, and operations as formal structures that can be constructed, combined, and analyzed with precision.

---

## SUBIT
A discrete semantic coordinate system composed of 64 semantic elements, 8 valences, and 3 bigrams of subjectivity. SUBIT provides the crystalline structure on which Semantic Engineering is built.

---

## SUBIT‑64
The set of 64 semantic elements formed by combining one inner valence (tension) with one outer valence (color). These elements constitute the semantic periodic table.

---

## SUBIT‑8
The set of eight valences used in SUBIT. Each valence has two aspects:
- inner valence (tension)
- outer valence (color)

---

## SUBIT‑3
The system of three binary bigrams encoding subjectivity:
- WHO  
- WHERE  
- WHEN  

Each bigram has four possible states, producing 64 subjectivity coordinates.

---

## Inner Valence (Tension)
The internal semantic force that drives an element’s operation.  
Represented by a single letter:

- S — Source tension  
- V — Vector tension  
- F — Field tension  
- M — Form tension  
- T — Turn tension  
- C — Compression tension  
- D — Disintegration tension  
- N — Null tension  

---

## Outer Valence (Color)
The external semantic expression of an element.  
Represented by a two‑letter color code:

- Bl — Blue  
- Gr — Green  
- Lm — Lime  
- Yl — Yellow  
- Or — Orange  
- Rd — Red  
- Bg — Burgundy  
- Pu — Purple  

---

## Semantic Element
A single unit of meaning defined by the combination of:
- inner valence (tension)  
- outer valence (color)  
- binary address  
- bigram coordinates  

Example: SBl, MOr, DPu.

---

## Binary Address
A 6‑bit code encoding subjectivity:
- bits 1–2: WHO  
- bits 3–4: WHERE  
- bits 5–6: WHEN  

This produces 64 possible subjectivity states.

---

## Bigram Coordinates
The decoded form of the binary address.  
Each bigram has four states:

### WHO  
ME / YOU / WE / THEY

### WHERE  
EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH

### WHEN  
SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER

---

## Trigram Identity
The combined representation of:
- valence (inner tension)  
- color (outer expression)  

Used to classify the operational and expressive mode of a semantic element.

---

## SUBIT Crystal
The 8×8 lattice formed by the interaction of inner valences (rows) and outer valences (columns). This crystalline topology organizes the 64 semantic elements into a stable, navigable structure.

---

## Semantic Lattice
The full coordinate space defined by:
- 64 semantic elements  
- 8 valences  
- 3 bigrams  
- 6‑bit binary addressing  

This lattice is the operational domain of Semantic Engineering.

---

## Semantic Operation
The transformation implied by a valence.  
Inner valence defines the internal force; outer valence defines the external expression.

---

## Semantic Coordinate
A complete specification of a semantic act, composed of:
- element (inner tension + outer color)  
- binary address  
- bigram coordinates  

This coordinate uniquely identifies a semantic state.

---

## Semantic Topology
The structural relationships between elements in the SUBIT Crystal, including adjacency, symmetry, locality, and diagonal continuity.

---

## Semantic Field
The operational space in which semantic elements interact, transform, and propagate according to valence mechanics and subjectivity coordinates.

---

## Meaning Structure
Any engineered configuration of semantic elements, valences, and coordinates used to model or construct meaning within a system.
