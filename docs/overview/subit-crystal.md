# SUBIT Crystal

The SUBIT Crystal is the structural topology of the SUBIT semantic space. It organizes the 64 semantic elements into an 8×8 lattice defined by the interaction of two independent axes:

- **inner valence (tension)** — the internal semantic force that shapes how meaning arises  
- **outer valence (color)** — the external semantic expression through which meaning manifests  

Each element is a stable intersection of one tension and one color, forming a crystalline semantic matrix.

## Inner Valence (Tension)

Inner valence defines the *internal operation* of a semantic element.  
It expresses the type of tension that drives the element from within.

- **S — Source tension**  
  spontaneous emergence, ignition, origination  
- **V — Vector tension**  
  directed push, orientation, propulsion  
- **F — Field tension**  
  expansion, diffusion, outward spread  
- **M — Form tension**  
  structuring, shaping, patterning  
- **T — Turn tension**  
  reorientation, pivot, rotation  
- **C — Compression tension**  
  contraction, focusing, limiting  
- **D — Disintegration tension**  
  breaking apart, dissolving, collapse  
- **N — Null tension**  
  clearing, emptying, suspension  

Inner valence answers the question:  
**What internal force is acting?**

## Outer Valence (Color)

Outer valence defines the *external expression* of a semantic element.  
It is represented by a two‑letter color code.

- **Bl — Blue**  
  cool emergence, calm initiation  
- **Gr — Green**  
  directional growth, guidance  
- **Lm — Lime**  
  radiant expansion, openness  
- **Yl — Yellow**  
  structural clarity, definition  
- **Or — Orange**  
  dynamic shift, rotation  
- **Rd — Red**  
  intensity, compression, force  
- **Bg — Burgundy**  
  decay, fragmentation, release  
- **Pu — Purple**  
  void, suspension, neutrality  

Outer valence answers the question:  
**How does the element manifest externally?**

## Crystal Structure

The SUBIT Crystal is an 8×8 matrix:

- rows = **inner valences (tensions)**  
- columns = **outer valences (colors)**  
- each cell = **one semantic element**  

This produces 64 unique combinations.

N     NBl   NGr   NLm   NYl   NOr   NRd   NBg   NPu
```

Each element is defined by:

- **inner tension** (row)  
- **outer color** (column)  
- **binary address** (6‑bit WHO/WHERE/WHEN)  
- **bigram coordinates**  
- **trigram identity** (tension + color)  

---

## Crystal Geometry

The SUBIT Crystal exhibits:

- **orthogonality** — tension and color operate independently  
- **symmetry** — each valence appears as both inner and outer  
- **locality** — adjacent cells differ by one valence shift  
- **continuity** — diagonals preserve valence identity  
- **color topology** — the eight colors form a semantic spectrum  

This geometry enables precise navigation and transformation within the semantic field.

## Function of the Crystal

The SUBIT Crystal serves as:

- the **periodic table** of semantic elements  
- the **coordinate grid** for meaning  
- the **operational map** for semantic transformations  
- the **foundation** of Semantic Engineering  

Every semantic act can be located, analyzed, and constructed within this crystalline topology.

## Summary

The SUBIT Crystal defines meaning through the interaction of:

- **inner valence (tension)**  
- **outer valence (color)**  

Their 64 combinations form a stable semantic lattice — a crystal of meaning that enables precise, discrete, and engineerable semantic design.
