# Structure

SUBIT‑64 is a unified 6‑bit semantic lattice.  
Its structure is defined by three synchronized layers:

- binary layer (6 bits)  
- bigram layer (WHO / WHERE / WHEN)  
- trigram layer (inner tension × outer color)

All three layers are isomorphic and describe the same 64‑element crystal.

---

## 1. Binary Layer (6 Bits)

The binary structure is the foundation.

b1 b2  |  b3 b4  |  b5 b6  
 WHO   | WHERE   | WHEN

- 6 bits form a 3‑segment coordinate  
- each segment is a 2‑bit bigram  
- total space: 2⁶ = 64 states

This is the computational representation of SUBIT.

---

## 2. Bigram Layer (WHO / WHERE / WHEN)

The bigram layer interprets the 6 bits as three axes:

- WHO: ME / WE / YOU / THEY  
- WHERE: EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH  
- WHEN: SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER  

Each axis is cyclic and reversible.

The bigram space is a 4×4×4 cube of subjectivity.

---

## 3. Trigram Layer (Tension × Color)

The trigram layer interleaves the bits:

inner = b1 b3 b5  
outer = b2 b4 b6

### Inner tensions (8)
S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N

### Outer colors (8)
Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu

The trigram space is an 8×8 semantic crystal.

## 4. Archetype Layer (Names)

Each coordinate corresponds to a canonical archetype name:

- one English name  
- one Ukrainian name  
- one structural action  

Names are derived from the tension–color interaction.

---

## 5. Isomorphic Structure

The three layers map perfectly:

6 bits  
↕  
3 bigrams  
↕  
2 trigrams  
↕  
1 archetype

Every transformation in one layer has an exact analogue in the others.

## 6. Crystal Geometry

SUBIT‑64 forms:

- a 6‑bit hypercube  
- a 4×4×4 bigram cube  
- an 8×8 trigram matrix  

These are three projections of the same structure.

---

## 7. Coordinate Identity

A SUBIT element is always defined by:

- binary code  
- bigram triple  
- trigram pair  
- archetype name  

Example:

Binary:   101010  
Bigram:   ME · EAST · SPRING  
Trigram:  FLm  
Name:     Radiate

All four refer to the same point.

## Summary

SUBIT‑64 is a unified semantic system built from:

- 6‑bit binary structure  
- 3‑axis bigram structure  
- 8×8 trigram structure  

These layers form a single coherent crystal of 64 archetypes, each with a precise coordinate and semantic action.
