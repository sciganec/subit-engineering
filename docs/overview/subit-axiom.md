# SUBIT Axiom

The SUBIT axiom defines the foundational rule of Semantic Engineering: any semantic act can be represented as a discrete coordinate composed of an element, a valence, and a subjectivity mode. This axiom establishes meaning as a structured, enumerable space rather than an interpretive continuum.

---

## Core Statement

A semantic act is fully described by the product:

**Element (64) × Valence (8) × Subjectivity (3 bigrams)**

This creates a finite semantic lattice where every position corresponds to a unique operational state of meaning.

## Components of the Axiom

### Semantic Element (SUBIT‑64)
A discrete unit representing an inner→outer transformation.  
Each element is defined by:
- an inner valence  
- an outer valence  
- a 6‑bit binary address  
- a trigram color‑valence identity  

These 64 elements form the semantic periodic table.

### Valence (SUBIT‑8)
An operational mode encoded as a trigram.  
Valences define how meaning transforms, propagates, or interacts.  
Each valence corresponds to:
- a structural operation  
- a color identity  
- a position in the 8‑state valence cycle  

### Subjectivity (SUBIT‑3)
A coordinate system describing the situational mode of meaning.  
It consists of three binary bigrams:

- **WHO**: ME / YOU / WE / THEY  
- **WHERE**: EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH  
- **WHEN**: SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER  

Each bigram is encoded as a 2‑bit pair.

## Binary Representation

The 6‑bit address of every semantic act is structured as:

- bits 1–2: WHO  
- bits 3–4: WHERE  
- bits 5–6: WHEN  

This creates 64 possible subjectivity states, each combinable with any valence.

---

## Crystalline Structure

The axiom produces a semantic crystal:

- 8 inner valences  
- 8 outer valences  
- 64 intersections  

Each intersection is a semantic element with a stable identity and operational role.

---

## Implications

The SUBIT axiom enables:

- discrete semantic modeling  
- deterministic transformation rules  
- composable meaning structures  
- unified treatment of subjectivity and operation  
- compatibility with computational systems  

It is the foundational rule that makes Semantic Engineering possible.

---

## Summary

The SUBIT axiom defines meaning as a structured coordinate in a finite semantic lattice.  
Every semantic act is a combination of:

- a semantic element  
- a valence operation  
- a subjectivity mode  

This transforms meaning into a domain that can be engineered with precision, stability, and formal clarity.
