# SUBIT Semantics

SUBIT defines meaning as a **coordinate‑based structure**.  
Every semantic state is a point in a 6‑bit lattice, simultaneously readable as:

- a binary configuration  
- a WHO/WHERE/WHEN bigram triple  
- an inner‑tension × outer‑color trigram pair  
- an archetype with a specific action and modality

Semantics in SUBIT is not associative or fuzzy: it is **deterministic, reversible, and geometric**.

---

## Semantic Layers

SUBIT semantics emerges from the alignment of three layers.

### Binary semantics  
Meaning is encoded as a 6‑bit pattern.  
Each bit contributes to a structural shift in the final interpretation.  
Bitwise operations correspond to semantic transformations.

### Bigram semantics  
Meaning is expressed through three axes:

- WHO — role or subjectivity  
- WHERE — orientation or direction  
- WHEN — phase or temporal state

These axes define **situational semantics**: perspective, position, and timing.

### Trigram semantics  
Meaning is expressed as:

- inner tension (S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N)  
- outer color (Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu)

This defines **action semantics** (what is happening) and **modal semantics** (how it happens).

---

## Semantic Identity

Each SUBIT element has a unified identity:

- binary code  
- bigram coordinate  
- trigram pair  
- archetype name  
- action + modality

These are not interpretations but **equivalent encodings** of the same semantic state.

Example:

Binary: 101010  
Bigram: ME · EAST · SPRING  
Trigram: FLm  
Archetype: Radiate  
Meaning: outward expansion in a light modality

---

## Semantic Adjacency

Two elements are semantically adjacent if:

- their binary codes differ by one bit  
- their bigrams differ by one axis step  
- their trigrams differ by one tension or color shift

Adjacency defines **semantic gradients**: minimal changes in meaning.

---

## Semantic Transformations

Transformations in SUBIT are structural and reversible.

### Inner‑shift  
Change the tension (S→V→F→M→T→C→D→N).  
Represents a shift in **action type**.

### Outer‑shift  
Change the color (Bl→Gr→Lm→Yl→Or→Rd→Bg→Pu).  
Represents a shift in **modal expression**.

### Bigram‑shift  
Change WHO, WHERE, or WHEN.  
Represents a shift in **role, orientation, or phase**.

### Binary‑shift  
Flip or rotate bits.  
Represents the **computational equivalent** of the above.

All transformations preserve semantic coherence.

## Semantic Composition

SUBIT allows combining states through structural operations:

- bitwise composition  
- bigram alignment  
- trigram resonance  
- archetype chaining

Composition is not symbolic concatenation but **geometric interaction**.

Example:  
FBl → FGr → FLm → FYl  
A semantic progression from calm expansion to bright expansion.

---

## Semantic Polarity

Each axis has a polarity:

- WHO: self ↔ collective  
- WHERE: inward ↔ outward  
- WHEN: early ↔ late  
- inner tension: constructive ↔ destructive  
- outer color: calm ↔ intense

Polarity defines **semantic direction** inside the crystal.

---

## Archetypal Semantics

Each of the 64 elements is an archetype with:

- a structural action  
- a modal tone  
- a situational frame  
- a binary signature

Archetypes are not metaphors; they are **canonical semantic atoms**.

---

## Semantic Coherence

SUBIT ensures coherence through:

- isomorphic mapping between layers  
- reversible transformations  
- adjacency‑preserving operations  
- unified coordinate identity

This makes SUBIT suitable for symbolic AI, reasoning engines, narrative systems, and generative semantics.

---

## Summary

SUBIT semantics is the interaction of:

- binary structure  
- situational roles  
- action‑modal trigrams  
- archetypal identities

Meaning is a **coordinate**, not a description.  
Transformation is **geometric**, not associative.  
Semantics is **deterministic**, not fuzzy.

SUBIT provides a complete, minimal, and reversible model of meaning across 64 canonical states.
