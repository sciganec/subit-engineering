# SUBIT Tension

Inner tension is the **action core** of every SUBIT trigram.  
It defines *what is happening* at the structural level, independent of modality or expression.  
Each tension is a 3‑bit pattern and one of the eight canonical action families of the SUBIT crystal.

---

## Role of Tension

Tension determines the **type of transformation** occurring in a state:

- constructive or destructive  
- expansive or contractive  
- stabilizing or destabilizing  
- orienting or disorienting  

Color answers *how* the action manifests;  
tension answers *what* the action fundamentally is.

## The Eight Tensions

Each tension corresponds to a 3‑bit code and a structural action archetype.

- **S — 100 — Stabilize**  
  Holding, grounding, maintaining form.  
  Action of anchoring or steadying.

- **V — 101 — Shift**  
  Tilting, leaning, rebalancing.  
  Action of subtle reorientation.

- **F — 110 — Expand**  
  Opening, branching, extending.  
  Action of outward growth.

- **M — 111 — Merge**  
  Combining, integrating, fusing.  
  Action of unification.

- **T — 011 — Turn**  
  Rotating, redirecting, pivoting.  
  Action of reorientation through motion.

- **C — 010 — Compress**  
  Narrowing, focusing, tightening.  
  Action of inward pressure.

- **D — 001 — Dissolve**  
  Breaking down, loosening, releasing.  
  Action of disintegration.

- **N — 000 — Null**  
  Absence, stillness, void.  
  Action of non‑action or reset.

## Tension Cycle

Tensions form a cyclic progression:

S → V → F → M → T → C → D → N → S

This cycle represents a complete loop of structural transformation:

- stabilize → shift → expand → merge → turn → compress → dissolve → null → stabilize

Each step is a minimal change in the action core.

## Tension and Trigram Interaction

A trigram is defined as:

inner tension × outer color

Tension determines the **action**, color determines the **modality**.

Examples:

- FBl — expansion in a calm modality  
- FRd — expansion in a force modality  
- DPu — dissolution in a void modality  
- MGr — merging in a balanced modality  

The tension stays constant; the color modifies its expression.

## Tension Geometry

Tension occupies the **inner 3 bits** of the 6‑bit coordinate:

b1 b3 b5 → tension

This creates:

- an 8‑point action ring  
- adjacency defined by 1‑bit difference  
- resonance with outer color through interleaving  
- full reversibility and symmetry

Tension geometry ensures that action shifts are structurally consistent across the entire crystal.

---

## Semantic Role of Tension

Tension defines:

- the core transformation  
- the direction of structural change  
- the internal mechanics of the state  
- the archetypal action family  

It is the **engine** of SUBIT semantics.

## Summary

SUBIT tension is the inner action of meaning:

- 8 tensions  
- 3‑bit codes  
- cyclic action progression  
- structural core of each archetype  
- fully integrated into the 6‑bit crystal

Tension determines *what* happens inside a state;  
color determines *how* it manifests.
