# SUBIT Color

The SUBIT color system defines the **outer modality** of every trigram.  
Color is not visual; it is a structural mode of expression that shapes how an action (inner tension) manifests in the world.  
Each color is a 3‑bit code and one of the eight canonical modalities of the SUBIT crystal.

## Color as Modality

Outer color determines the **tone**, **intensity**, and **direction** of a state.  
It answers the question: *How does this action express itself?*

Color does not change the action itself (that is the role of inner tension), but it changes the **style** and **impact** of the action.

## The Eight Colors

Each color corresponds to a 3‑bit pattern and a modal archetype.

- **Bl — Blue — 100**  
  Calm, diffuse, steady, cooling.  
  Expression through stability and quiet expansion.

- **Gr — Green — 101**  
  Balanced, adaptive, responsive.  
  Expression through flexible adjustment.

- **Lm — Lime — 110**  
  Light, open, radiant.  
  Expression through illumination and outward clarity.

- **Yl — Yellow — 111**  
  Warm, active, energizing.  
  Expression through activation and intensification.

- **Or — Orange — 011**  
  Shifting, transitional, volatile.  
  Expression through change, rotation, and reorientation.

- **Rd — Red — 010**  
  Forceful, direct, pressurized.  
  Expression through impact and decisive push.

- **Bg — Burgundy — 001**  
  Deep, heavy, saturated.  
  Expression through density, weight, and inward pull.

- **Pu — Purple — 000**  
  Void, dissolution, negation.  
  Expression through absence, release, or collapse.

## Modal Cycles

Colors form a cyclic progression:

Bl → Gr → Lm → Yl → Or → Rd → Bg → Pu → Bl

This cycle represents a full rotation of expressive modalities:

- calm → balanced → open → active → shifting → forceful → heavy → void → calm

Each step is a minimal modal shift in the SUBIT crystal.

## Color and Trigram Interaction

A trigram is defined as:

inner tension × outer color

Color determines **how** the tension manifests:

- FBl — expansion in a calm modality  
- FGr — expansion in a balanced modality  
- FLm — expansion in a radiant modality  
- FYl — expansion in an active modality  
- FOr — expansion in a shifting modality  
- FRd — expansion in a force modality  
- FBg — expansion in a heavy modality  
- FPu — expansion in a void modality

The inner tension stays constant; the color changes the expressive mode.

## Color Geometry

Color occupies the **outer 3 bits** of the 6‑bit coordinate:

b2 b4 b6 → color

This creates:

- an 8‑point modal ring  
- adjacency defined by 1‑bit difference  
- diagonal resonance with inner tensions  
- full reversibility and symmetry

Color geometry ensures that modal shifts are structurally consistent across the entire crystal.

---

## Semantic Role of Color

Color defines:

- intensity  
- tone  
- direction  
- openness or closure  
- stability or volatility  
- weight or lightness  
- presence or absence  

It is the **emotional and modal layer** of SUBIT semantics.

## Summary

SUBIT color is the outer modality of meaning:

- 8 colors  
- 3‑bit codes  
- cyclic modal progression  
- expressive tone of each archetype  
- structural, not visual  
- fully integrated into the 6‑bit crystal

Color determines *how* an action feels, moves, and manifests within the SUBIT lattice.
