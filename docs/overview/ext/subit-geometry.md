# SUBIT Geometry

SUBIT is a 6‑bit semantic crystal whose geometry emerges from the alignment of three structural layers: the binary hypercube, the bigram cube, and the trigram matrix. Each layer is a projection of the same underlying coordinate system, and every movement in one layer has an exact analogue in the others.

## Binary Geometry (6‑bit hypercube)

The binary layer forms a 6‑dimensional cube with 64 vertices.  
Each coordinate is divided into three 2‑bit segments:

b1 b2  |  b3 b4  |  b5 b6  
WHO    | WHERE   | WHEN

The geometry of this layer is defined by:

- orthogonal axes for each bit  
- local adjacency (Hamming distance 1)  
- rotational symmetry within each bigram pair  
- full hypercube symmetry across all six bits

This is the computational skeleton of SUBIT.

## Bigram Geometry (4×4×4 cube)

The bigram layer interprets the 6‑bit hypercube as a 3‑axis semantic cube:

- WHO: ME, WE, YOU, THEY  
- WHERE: EAST, SOUTH, WEST, NORTH  
- WHEN: SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER

Each axis is cyclic, forming a toroidal structure rather than a closed cube.  
The geometry is defined by:

- 4 positions per axis  
- 64 total coordinates  
- rotational adjacency (e.g., EAST → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH → EAST)  
- role‑based adjacency (ME → WE → YOU → THEY → ME)

This layer expresses spatial, temporal, and subjective orientation.

## Trigram Geometry (8×8 crystal)

The trigram layer interleaves the bits into two 3‑bit trigrams:

inner = b1 b3 b5  
outer = b2 b4 b6

Inner tensions (8): S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N  
Outer colors (8): Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu

The geometry forms an 8×8 matrix with:

- cyclic tension transitions  
- cyclic color transitions  
- diagonal dual‑shift paths  
- modal adjacency based on shared bit patterns

This layer expresses action, modality, and semantic valence.

---

## Isomorphic Geometry

The three layers are structurally identical:

6 bits  
↕  
3 bigrams  
↕  
2 trigrams

A movement in one layer corresponds to a movement in the others:

- flipping a bit ↔ shifting a bigram ↔ rotating tension or color  
- swapping bits ↔ rotating axes ↔ modal reorientation  
- full inversion ↔ WHO/WHERE/WHEN reversal ↔ tension/color inversion

This is the core isomorphism of SUBIT.

---

## Geometric Transformations

Transformations preserve the structure of the crystal:

- local moves: change one bit, one bigram, or one trigram component  
- axial cycles: full rotation along WHO, WHERE, WHEN, inner, or outer  
- orbital cycles: combined rotations (WHO+WHERE, inner+outer)  
- global operations: mirror, full inversion, full rotation

These operations define the navigational geometry of SUBIT.

---

## Coordinate Identity

Each point in the geometry has four synchronized identities:

- binary code  
- bigram coordinate  
- trigram pair  
- archetype name

Example:

Binary: 101010  
Bigram: ME · EAST · SPRING  
Trigram: FLm  
Archetype: Radiate

All four describe the same geometric position.

---

## Crystal Interpretation

SUBIT can be viewed as:

- a 6‑dimensional hypercube  
- a 3‑axis semantic cube  
- an 8×8 modal crystal  
- a 64‑element archetype field

These are not separate structures but different projections of the same geometry.

---

## Summary

SUBIT geometry is the alignment of:

- the binary hypercube  
- the bigram cube  
- the trigram crystal

This unified structure enables reversible mapping, consistent transformation, and semantic coherence across all 64 archetypes.
