# Transformations

SUBIT‑64 forms a closed system of transformations.  
Every element can change along three independent dimensions:

- binary transformations (operations on six bits)
- bigram transformations (WHO / WHERE / WHEN)
- trigram transformations (inner tension × outer color)

All three layers are isomorphic: any operation on one layer has an exact analogue on the others.

## Binary Transformations (6‑bit operations)

The binary layer is the fundamental representation.  
Every transformation is an operation on a 6‑bit vector.

### Core operations

- flip(i) — invert bit i  
- swap(i,j) — exchange bits i and j  
- rotate(WHO/WHERE/WHEN) — cyclic shift inside a bigram  
- mirror — invert all bits  
- shift — move bits left or right  

These operations preserve the SUBIT structure and always produce valid elements.

## Bigram Transformations (WHO / WHERE / WHEN)

The bigram layer describes transformations in subjectivity, direction, and phase.

### WHO transformations
ME → WE → YOU → THEY → ME  
Changes the subject without affecting direction or season.

### WHERE transformations
EAST → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH → EAST  
Rotational movement in directional space.

### WHEN transformations
SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER → SPRING  
Cyclic movement through phases.

### Combined transformations
- WHO+WHERE — subject and direction shift  
- WHERE+WHEN — directional rotation across seasons  
- WHO+WHEN — role change across time  

Every bigram transformation corresponds to a precise bit‑level operation.

## Trigram Transformations (inner × outer)

The trigram layer describes transformations in tensions and color modalities.

### Inner (tension) cycle
S → V → F → M → T → C → D → N → S  
A full cycle of internal actions: emergence → direction → expansion → structure → turn → compression → disintegration → null.

### Outer (color) cycle
Bl → Gr → Lm → Yl → Or → Rd → Bg → Pu → Bl  
A full cycle of modalities: calm → growth → openness → structure → change → force → decay → void.

### Combined transformations
- inner‑shift: change tension, keep color  
- outer‑shift: change color, keep tension  
- dual‑shift: change both simultaneously  

Each trigram transformation corresponds to a specific binary operation.

## Isomorphism of Transformations

Any transformation in SUBIT has three equivalent expressions:

Binary:   flip(1), swap(3,5), rotate(WHO)  
Bigram:   ME → WE, EAST → SOUTH  
Trigram:  SBl → VGr  

These are three readings of the same movement.

## Transformation Classes

### Local transformations
Affect one dimension:
- WHO only  
- WHERE only  
- WHEN only  
- inner only  
- outer only  

### Axial transformations
Complete cycle along one axis:
- full WHO cycle  
- full inner cycle  
- full outer cycle  

### Orbital transformations
Combine two cycles:
- WHO+WHERE  
- inner+outer  

### Global transformations
Affect all three layers simultaneously:
- mirror  
- full rotation  
- full inversion  

---

## Examples

### Example 1 — inner‑shift
MOr → TOr  
Form becomes turn; color unchanged.

### Example 2 — outer‑shift
FBl → FGr  
Expansion moves into a growth modality.

### Example 3 — bigram rotation
ME · EAST · SPRING → ME · SOUTH · SPRING  
Directional rotation.

### Example 4 — binary mirror
101010 → 010101  
Full inversion of the coordinate.

## Summary

SUBIT transformations are:

- operations on six bits  
- cycles in WHO / WHERE / WHEN  
- cycles in tension / color  

All three layers are synchronized and describe the same movement within SUBIT‑64.
