# Usage

SUBIT‑64 can be used as a coordinate system, a semantic engine, or a structural reasoning tool.  
Every operation in SUBIT works through the same three synchronized layers:

- 6‑bit binary address  
- WHO/WHERE/WHEN bigrams  
- tension/color trigrams  

This makes SUBIT applicable in modeling, analysis, generation, and transformation tasks.

## Reading an Element

A single element can be read in three ways:

Binary → 101010  
Bigram → ME · EAST · SPRING  
Trigram → FLm  
Name → Radiate (or the chosen canonical name)

All four readings refer to the same archetype.

---

## Using Bigram Space (WHO / WHERE / WHEN)

Bigram space is useful for:

- modeling subjectivity  
- tracking roles and perspectives  
- mapping narrative or conversational states  
- encoding spatial or temporal shifts  

Example:

ME → WE → YOU → THEY  
EAST → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH  
SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER

Each axis is cyclic and reversible.

## Using Trigram Space (Tension × Color)

Trigram space is the semantic engine of SUBIT.  
It is used for:

- describing actions  
- modeling processes  
- generating transformations  
- encoding emotional or structural states  

Inner tension defines the action family:  
S, V, F, M, T, C, D, N

Outer color defines the modality:  
Bl, Gr, Lm, Yl, Or, Rd, Bg, Pu

Example:

MOr → structural action in a shifting modality  
TBl → reorientation in a calm modality

---

## Using Binary Space (6 Bits)

Binary space is the computational layer.  
It is used for:

- bitwise operations  
- algorithmic transformations  
- hashing and encoding  
- reversible mappings  

Example operations:

flip(1)  
swap(3,5)  
mirror  
rotate(WHO)

Every binary operation has a bigram and trigram interpretation.

## Transformations in Practice

Transformations allow movement through SUBIT‑64:

- inner‑shift: change tension  
- outer‑shift: change color  
- bigram‑shift: change WHO/WHERE/WHEN  
- binary‑shift: operate directly on bits  

Example:

FBl → FGr → FLm → FYl  
(expansion through modalities)

ME · EAST · SPRING → ME · SOUTH · SPRING  
(rotation in directional space)

---

## Mapping Between Layers

Mappings allow conversion between representations:

Binary → Bigram  
Binary → Trigram  
Trigram → Name  
Bigram → Name  

Example:

Binary: 111001  
Inner bits: 110 → F  
Outer bits: 101 → Gr  
Bigram: WE · EAST · AUTUMN  
Name: Branch

---

## Practical Applications

SUBIT‑64 can be used for:

- semantic modeling  
- narrative generation  
- reasoning engines  
- symbolic AI  
- process mapping  
- emotional or modal analysis  
- structural transformations  
- multi‑axis classification  
- generative systems  

Because all layers are synchronized, any operation in one layer propagates meaningfully to the others.

---

## Summary

SUBIT‑64 provides:

- a universal coordinate  
- a semantic action  
- a modal expression  
- a structural transformation path  

It is a unified system for modeling, generating, and transforming meaning across binary, spatial‑temporal, and semantic layers.
